Synopsis of Project:
 This project will simulate a technical trivia card game. The game will randomly populate a deck with questions and their corresponding answers and prompt the user to answer the questions accordingly. This game will take place entirely on the terminal.

cd into the directory that you have cloned down and then type into the terminal `node index.js`
